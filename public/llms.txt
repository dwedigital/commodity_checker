> AI-powered UK commodity code lookup for importers

## What is Tariffik?

Tariffik is a web application that helps individuals and businesses find the correct UK commodity codes (also known as HS codes or tariff codes) for products they are importing. These codes are required for customs declarations and determine the duty rates applied to imports.

## Core Features

- **Product URL Lookup**: Paste a product URL from any retailer and get commodity code suggestions
- **Photo Lookup**: Upload a product photo to identify items and get code suggestions
- **Email Forwarding**: Forward order confirmation emails to automatically extract products and suggest codes
- **AI-Powered Suggestions**: Uses AI to analyse product descriptions and match them to the UK Trade Tariff
- **Confidence Ratings**: Each suggestion includes a confidence score and reasoning

## How It Works

1. User provides a product description, URL, or photo
2. Tariffik extracts product details (description, materials, intended use)
3. The UK Trade Tariff API is searched for relevant commodity codes
4. AI analyses the results and suggests the most appropriate code
5. User can confirm or adjust the suggestion

## Commodity Code Information

UK commodity codes are 10-digit numbers that classify goods for import/export:
- First 6 digits: International Harmonized System (HS) code
- Digits 7-8: EU/UK subdivision
- Digits 9-10: UK national subdivision

Example: 8471 30 00 00 = Portable computers (laptops)
