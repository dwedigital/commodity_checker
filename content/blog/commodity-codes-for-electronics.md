Electronics are among the most commonly imported consumer goods, yet their commodity codes can be surprisingly tricky to get right. A phone case isn't classified the same way as a phone, and a laptop charger has a different code to the laptop itself.

This guide breaks down the most common electronics categories and their UK commodity codes.

## Smartphones and Mobile Phones

Mobile phones fall under Chapter 85 of the tariff (Electrical machinery and equipment). The specific code depends on whether the device is designed for cellular networks.

**Smartphones and cellular phones:**
- **8517 13 00 00** - Telephones for cellular networks or other wireless networks

This covers all modern smartphones regardless of manufacturer - iPhones, Samsung Galaxy, Google Pixel, and others all use the same code.

**Key point:** The duty rate for smartphones imported into the UK is currently **0%**, making classification errors less costly financially - but still important for compliance.

## Laptops and Computers

Computers are classified under heading 8471, with different codes depending on the type:

**Laptops and notebooks:**
- **8471 30 00 00** - Portable digital automatic data processing machines, weighing not more than 10 kg

**Desktop computers:**
- **8471 49 00 00** - Other digital automatic data processing machines (for complete desktop systems)
- **8471 50 00 00** - Digital processing units (for the tower/unit alone, without monitor)

**Tablets:**
- **8471 30 00 00** - Same as laptops if they function as a full computer
- **8517 13 00 00** - If cellular-enabled and primarily used as a communication device

The tablet classification can be contentious. An iPad Pro with a keyboard might be argued either way, but HMRC generally accepts 8471 30 00 00 for devices marketed as productivity tools.

## Computer Accessories

This is where it gets interesting. Each accessory type has its own classification:

### Monitors and Displays
- **8528 52 10 00** - Monitors capable of directly connecting to a computer (most modern monitors)
- **8528 52 91 00** - Other monitors with LCD/LED displays

### Keyboards and Mice
- **8471 60 70 00** - Keyboards
- **8471 60 80 00** - Mice and other pointing devices (including trackpads)

### Storage Devices
- **8471 70 20 00** - External hard drives and SSDs
- **8523 51 00 00** - USB flash drives (solid-state non-volatile storage)

### Webcams and Cameras
- **8525 89 00 00** - Digital cameras and webcams

### Headphones and Audio
- **8518 30 95 00** - Headphones and earphones (wired or wireless)
- **8518 21 00 00** - Single loudspeakers (Bluetooth speakers)
- **8518 22 00 00** - Multiple loudspeakers in the same enclosure

## Chargers and Power Accessories

Chargers are frequently misclassified. The correct code depends on the charger type:

### Power Adapters and Chargers
- **8504 40 90 00** - AC/DC adapters and chargers (the plug that goes in the wall)

### Power Banks
- **8507 60 00 00** - Lithium-ion power banks and portable batteries

### Cables
- **8544 42 90 00** - USB cables, charging cables, data cables (fitted with connectors)

**Common mistake:** Classifying a charger under the same code as the device it charges. A phone charger is not classified as phone equipment - it's an electrical transformer/adapter.

## Protective Cases and Covers

Cases are classified based on their material:

### Plastic Cases
- **3926 90 97 00** - Articles of plastics (most hard phone/laptop cases)

### Leather Cases
- **4205 00 90 00** - Articles of leather (genuine leather cases)
- **4202 32 90 00** - Wallets and pouches of leather with phone compartments

### Textile Cases
- **6307 90 98 00** - Made-up textile articles (fabric sleeves and pouches)

### Combined Materials
If a case combines materials (leather exterior with plastic frame), classify by the material that gives the item its essential character - usually the outer material.

## Smart Watches and Wearables

Wearable technology has specific classifications:

- **8517 62 00 00** - Smartwatches with communication functions (Apple Watch, Galaxy Watch)
- **9102 12 00 00** - Wrist watches with electronic display only (basic fitness trackers without communication)
- **9029 20 31 00** - Speedometers and similar (some cycling computers)

The distinction matters: a smartwatch that can receive calls uses the telecom code, while a simple step counter uses the watch code.

## Gaming Equipment

### Consoles
- **9504 50 00 00** - Video game consoles (PlayStation, Xbox, Nintendo Switch)

### Controllers
- **9504 50 00 00** - Game controllers sold separately still fall under gaming equipment

### Gaming Accessories
- **8471 60 80 00** - Gaming mice (same as regular mice)
- **8518 30 95 00** - Gaming headsets

## Common Classification Mistakes

### 1. Bundled Products
When electronics are sold as a set (phone with charger and earphones), you typically classify by the main item - but may need to split the value if items are separately identifiable and significant.

### 2. Refurbished vs New
Refurbished electronics use the same commodity codes as new items. The condition doesn't change the classification.

### 3. Parts vs Complete Items
A replacement laptop screen uses a different code than a complete laptop. Parts and components have their own classifications under headings 8473 (computer parts) and 8517 70 (phone parts).

### 4. Multi-function Devices
For devices that do multiple things (phone that's also a camera that's also a music player), classify by the primary function - which for smartphones is communication.

## Duty Rates at a Glance

Most consumer electronics enjoy low or zero duty rates in the UK:

| Product | Typical Duty Rate |
|---------|------------------|
| Smartphones | 0% |
| Laptops | 0% |
| Tablets | 0% |
| Monitors | 0% |
| Headphones | 0% |
| Chargers | 0% |
| Cables | 0% |
| Phone cases (plastic) | 6.5% |
| Phone cases (leather) | 3% |

**Note:** While duty may be zero, you'll still pay 20% VAT on imports valued over £135.

## Getting It Right

Electronics classification requires attention to detail. When in doubt:

1. **Check the product's primary function** - this usually determines the heading
2. **Note the materials** - especially important for accessories and cases
3. **Consider connectivity** - cellular capability changes classification for some devices
4. **Look up the exact code** - don't assume similar products share codes
