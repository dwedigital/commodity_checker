Clothing is one of the most commonly imported product categories in the UK, but it's also one of the trickiest to classify correctly. The difference between a "pullover" and a "cardigan" or "woven" and "knitted" can mean different duty rates and potential customs issues.

## Why Clothing Classification is Complex

Unlike electronics or machinery where the function often determines the code, clothing classification depends on multiple factors:

- **Material composition** (cotton, wool, synthetic, blends)
- **Construction method** (knitted vs woven)
- **Garment type** (shirt, jacket, trousers)
- **Gender/age** (men's, women's, children's)
- **Whether it's part of a set**

Getting any of these wrong can result in the wrong commodity code.

## Key Chapters for Clothing

Most clothing falls into two main chapters of the UK Trade Tariff:

### Chapter 61: Knitted or Crocheted Clothing

This includes garments made from knitted fabric - think t-shirts, jumpers, leggings, and most casual wear.

Common codes:
- **6109** - T-shirts, singlets, vests (knitted)
- **6110** - Jerseys, pullovers, cardigans, waistcoats (knitted)
- **6104** - Women's suits, dresses, skirts (knitted)
- **6103** - Men's suits, jackets, trousers (knitted)

### Chapter 62: Woven Clothing

This covers garments made from woven fabric - typically shirts, blouses, tailored jackets, and formal wear.

Common codes:
- **6205** - Men's shirts (woven)
- **6206** - Women's blouses and shirts (woven)
- **6203** - Men's suits, jackets, trousers (woven)
- **6204** - Women's suits, jackets, dresses, skirts (woven)

## The Material Question

After determining the garment type, the next critical factor is material composition. The code changes based on:

### Natural Fibres
- **Cotton** - Most common, often lower duty rates
- **Wool/fine animal hair** - Includes cashmere, alpaca
- **Silk** - Premium category with specific codes
- **Flax/linen** - Separate classification

### Synthetic Fibres
- **Man-made fibres** - Polyester, nylon, acrylic
- **Artificial fibres** - Viscose, rayon

### Blended Materials

Here's where it gets tricky. When a garment contains multiple materials, classification follows the **predominant material by weight** rule.

A jumper that's 60% cotton and 40% polyester is classified as cotton. But if it's 45% cotton and 55% polyester, it's classified under synthetic fibres.

Always check the care label or product specifications for the exact composition.

## Common Classification Mistakes

### 1. Confusing Knitted and Woven

A common error is misclassifying a woven cotton shirt (Chapter 62) as a knitted item (Chapter 61). The visual difference isn't always obvious, but the codes are entirely different.

**Tip:** Knitted fabric stretches in all directions. Woven fabric typically only stretches diagonally (on the bias).

### 2. Ignoring Gender Classification

Men's and women's garments have different codes, even if they look identical. A unisex t-shirt must still be classified - usually based on how it's marketed or cut.

### 3. Sets vs Individual Items

A matching jacket and trousers sold together might be classified as a suit (one code) or as separate items (two codes), depending on whether they meet the legal definition of a suit.

### 4. Misidentifying Garment Type

Is it a jacket or a coat? A pullover or a cardigan? These distinctions matter:

- **Pullover** - Goes over the head, no front opening
- **Cardigan** - Opens at the front with buttons or zip
- **Jacket** - Typically hip-length or shorter
- **Coat** - Longer, designed for outerwear

## Duty Rates: Why Accuracy Matters

Clothing duty rates vary significantly. For example:

| Item | Approximate Duty Rate |
|------|----------------------|
| Cotton t-shirt (knitted) | 12% |
| Synthetic t-shirt (knitted) | 12% |
| Wool jumper (knitted) | 12% |
| Silk blouse (woven) | 12% |
| Leather jacket | 4% |
| Cotton shirt (woven) | 12% |

While many standard clothing items attract similar rates, the differences in specific subcategories can be significant. More importantly, using the wrong code can trigger customs queries, delays, and potential penalties.

## Tips for Accurate Classification

1. **Always check the composition label** - Don't guess the material
2. **Know if it's knitted or woven** - This determines the chapter
3. **Be specific about the garment type** - Generic descriptions cause problems
4. **Consider the intended wearer** - Men's, women's, or children's
5. **Check if items form a set** - Suits have specific rules

## How Tariffik Simplifies This

Instead of manually navigating the Trade Tariff's thousands of clothing codes, Tariffik analyses your product descriptions and suggests the most appropriate code.

Simply:
1. Paste a product URL or description
2. Our AI identifies the garment type, material, and other key factors
3. Get a suggested commodity code with confidence rating
4. Review the reasoning to understand why that code was selected

Whether you're importing a single designer piece or containers of fast fashion, accurate classification keeps your shipments moving and your costs predictable.
